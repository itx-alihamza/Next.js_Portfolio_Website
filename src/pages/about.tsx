                Hi, I'm <b>CodeBucks</b>, a web developer and UI/UX designer
                with a passion for creating beautiful, functional, and
                user-centered digital experiences. With 4 years of experience in
                the field. I am always looking for new and innovative ways to
                bring my clients' visions to life.
              </p>
              <p className="">
                I believe that design is about more than just making things look
                pretty â€“ it's about solving problems and creating intuitive,
                enjoyable experiences for users.
              </p>
              <p>
                Whether I'm working on a website, mobile app, or other digital
                product, I bring my commitment to design excellence and
                user-centered thinking to every project I work on. I look
                forward to the opportunity to bring my skills and passion to
                your next project.
              </p>
